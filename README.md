# python-webapp-website
A google app engine personal website

This is a web application that I really want to serve as my website. It isn't currently deployed anywhere. 
Hopefully that will change. I want to learn various technologies such as the webapp2 framework,
google app engine, and extend this to include css and javascript to make the website run on the client side.
